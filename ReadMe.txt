## Next Word predictor is a Python Deep Learning Based project check requirements.txt for the used libraries

1. Tools Required (Model runtime atleast 30 mins)
	a.gogle Collab (preferrend as the tensorflow gui is prebuild it takes faster run time than jupyter)
	b.anaconda model (runtime takes time)
	c. open Next_word_model.ipynb Processing and trained Notebook 
2. as it is taking time model has been prebuild and dumped for using predictions

3. Open Prediction.ipynb 
	- which nextword1.h5 (model loaded), tokenozer.pk1 (dumped tokenizer is loaded)
	- can run the prediction file to check the predictions
	- sample texts can be given to see the output.
4. Text document used for model building is proveded 
5. Check the report for the understanding of the algorithms used.
